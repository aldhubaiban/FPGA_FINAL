Part 1 (counter )

 

In order to initialize all the states  we must begin with reset =’1’ then change to ‘0’ to make the system work

 

The system will read an input and if it detectes “1001” or “0101” it will add +1 to the output

 

Part2 (Divison )

 

In order to initialize all the states  we must begin with reset =’1’ then change to ‘0’ to make the system work

 

When reset=’1’ it will assign

 

Master to send numbers

Slave to be idle

 

*NOTE (system won’t do anything because reset=’1’)

 

After that when  reset= ‘0’ the system works

 

1-Master to send numbers

1-Slave to be idle

 

2-Master is idle

2-Slave perform division

 

3- Master is check number validation then repeat step 1

3- slave is idle
